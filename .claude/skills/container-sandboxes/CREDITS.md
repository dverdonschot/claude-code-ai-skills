# Credits

## Acknowledgments

This skill was inspired by and adapted from ideas in the following projects:

### Agent Sandbox Skill
- **Repository**: [agent-sandbox-skill](https://github.com/disler/agent-sandbox-skill.git)
- **Author**: disler
- **Contribution**: Original concepts and implementation ideas for both:
  - Container-based sandboxes for AI agents
  - CBS (Dutch Statistics) dataset analyzer

The container-sandboxes implementation builds upon the sandbox concepts from this project, adapted to support both Docker and Podman with enhanced features for local execution.

The cbs-analyzer skill was inspired by the CBS Open Data integration patterns demonstrated in the original project.
